 //About the project
 
  The project is a two-dimensional web browser video game that is made with 8-bit graphics. The goal of the game is to control the character and guide her through a three-story building. If the character reaches the third floor and grabs the one and only item in the game, the player clears the game. However, each floor offers an enemy that creates a challenging experience. Enemies can't be defeated/killed, so the player must avoid them at any cost by jumping over them without touching any walls in the game. Each floor can be accessed through small doors. As more time passes, the enemies become harder to avoid.
