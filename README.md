 //About the project
 
  The project is a two-dimensional web browser video game that is made with 8-bit graphics. The goal of the game is to control the character and guide her through a three-story building. If the character reaches the third floor and grabs the one and only item in the game, the player clears the game. However, each floor offers an enemy that creates a challenging experience. Enemies can't be defeated/killed, so the player must avoid them at any cost by jumping over them without touching any walls in the game. Each floor can be accessed through small doors. As more time passes, the enemies become harder to avoid.

  This particular assignment was chosen because the goal of the project was to show whether if the students could utilize the language interoperation skills that was taught throughout the semester. Unlike most assignments, this one was more time consuming and challenging. The project was implemented in Elm, which was a language that was never taught before or during the class period. Since, the amount of time required for the assignment was long, it helped to reach some of the Computer Science learning goals.

  The project definitely helped to understand the concepts and techniques of software design because of one of the requirements was to come up with a program that worked on a web browser. This allowed us to come up with ideas and designs for programs that was suitable. Students were required to learn the concept of html and the proper techniques that allowed our algorithm to be functional. In order to complete the tasks, we determined the needed interface, components and software. The tasks were completed individually or in a group setting consisting of 3 members. However, this project was created by one individual.
